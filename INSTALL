DEPENDENCIES

The TrajectoryExplorer has the following dependencies:

1. Qt (tested with Qt 5.5.1 and Qmake 3.0)

2. The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library (tested with GLEW 1.13)

3. QGLViewer -- A Qt-based 3D viewer: http://libqglviewer.com/ (tested with
QGLViewer 2.6.3)

4. GLE Tubing and Extrusion Library : http://www.linas.org/gle/ (tested with
GLE 3.1.0)

The code assumes that Qt and GLEW are already available, whereas the build
script downloads and installs QGLViewer and GLE automatically in a local path
(see step 2 in INSTALLATION). 

To correct/modify paths for any of these libraries, please see
TrajectoryExplorer/TrajectoryExplorer.pro.


INSTALLATION

1. Download the code from git repository.

2. Change the current directory to TrajectoryExplorer/extlibs. Execute the build
script buildlibs.sh. This downloads and installs QGLViewer-2.6.3 and gle-3.1.0
libraries.

3. Change the current directory to TrajectoryExplorer, and create a new build
directory (TrajectoryExplorer/build) for out-of-source installation. The
following commands builds the source code, and creates the executable
'TrajectoryExplorer'. 

qmake ../ 

make

EXECUTION

The program requires a config file to specify input parameters, and can be
executed as 

TrajectoryExplorer <config-filename>
